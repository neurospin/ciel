# How to contribute

The easiest way to update the content of the site is to create an issue from
the GitHub interface:

- first, log in to your GitHub account.
- go to the issue page: https://github.com/neurospin/ciel/issues.
- click the "New issue" button.
- fill out the appropriate template.

If you want to contribute more deeply:

- first, log in to your GitHub account.
- fork the repository.
- modify the code and test it locally (see the [Configuration](#configuration)
  and [Local Install](#local-install) sections.
- create a Pull Request to the main repository


# Configuration

You have to customize the following parameters in `_config.yml`:

- title: the name of your team.
- subtitle: the running title.
- email: the contact email.
- short_desc: the title of the banner in the index page.
- long_desc: the content of the banner in the index page.
- expiration_opportunities: the job offers will expire automatically after this number of days.
- expiration_news: the news will expire automatically after this number of days.

You can change the banner image in the index page `images/banner.png` and the logo `images/logo.png`.

Then you will need to fill the collections in `_collections` (only text files).
Please look at the example and use the same keys.

Note: For the research collection, you will have to add a new `research_<CATEGORY>.md` for new categories.
